        <b>Technology:</b> 

                    My number one hobby and interest is technology and that is why I am studying programming now in CIIT. I love tinkering with 
                electronics because I am always fascinated by technology and how it works and I am not only fascinated by computer hardware, unlike 
                most other people who like electronics I love electronics/technology as a whole. I always watch YouTube videos about technology 
                because I love learning about new technology and I watch videos because I like to learn how to fix broken pieces of electronics. 
                Before I am so obsessed with hardware and now I am satisfied with my knowledge of hardware and now I am learning about the software 
                side of things because I would like to know how the technology works both hardware wise and software wise.

        <b>Mechanical Keyboards:</b>  

                    I like the customization that a mechanical keyboard could have. The components, the feel, the look, and the aesthetic of a 
                mechanical keyboard is why I like custom mechanical keyboards although I don't have a custom mechanical keyboard I tried on 
                customizing my mechanical keyboard which kinda makes it a partial custom mechanical keyboard but I am hoping I could make myself 
                a custom mechanical keyboard in the future.
