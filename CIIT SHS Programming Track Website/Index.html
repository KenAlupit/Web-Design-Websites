                        CODE.ORG is a US-based organization that makes computer science and programming skills more accessible to students and other minorities 
                        worldwide. The curriculum is developed by engineers in Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, and Amazon.com. CIIT Philippines is the first Senior High 
                        School in the country to adopt this curriculum.

                        <b>-Preparation for Philippine Programmers Rating (PPR)</b>
                        Learn to code properly, and make lightning speed logical decisions and creative processes through the 560-hour extensive computer laboratory-based 
                        training geared towards preparing our students to take the Philippine Programmers Rating (PPR). PPR, a recognized examination by numerous 
                        members of the Philippine Software Industry Association, is the first automated assessment tool aligned with the needs of the Philippine software 
                        industry. This examination was developed to identify entry-level programming talent in the country.
